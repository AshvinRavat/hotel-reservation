 check for rooms available for specified date range for number of guest

   1)first thing is to "check date range" with "room availability".

        how to do that?? take date-range, & total guest.

        how to check for room availability ??? 

        fire query for date-range & get booked_rooms, & ROOM id(s)
        & get the count of that room repeated how many times.
        using this we will get the total room booked of different room categories

        store this into array called Booked_Rooms

        for example : 
            select count(id)as booked_rooms, room_od from room_reservation_items
            ->where(function ($query) use ($startDate, $endDate) {
            $query->where(function ($q2) use ($startDate) {
                $q2->where('start_date', '<=', $startDate);
                $q2->where('end_date', '>=', $startDate);
            });
            $query->orWhere(function ($q3) use ($endDate) {
                $q3->where('start_date', '<=', $endDate);
                $q3->where('end_date', '>=', $endDate);
            });
            $query->orWhere(function ($query1) use ($startDate, $endDate) {
                $query1->where('end_date', '<=', $endDate);
                $query1->where('start_date', '>=', $startDate);
            });
        })


   2)COMPARE BOOKED ROOM WITH FREE ROOMS : 
        
        1) get count of free room
        now fire query on rooms table with below condition:
            select total_rooms, id from rooms max_occupancy 
            where total_rooms > booked_rooms and id = room_id, 

            using this result we will get the rooms that are available.

            store this data in array CALLED FREE ROOMS.

          
            WHAT ABOUT OTHER ROOMS, WHICH ARE NOT BOOKED BUT STILL NEED TO LIST TO USERS ???   
            another way is fetch room id & again fetch all those rooms from room table where room id not in from above result.
            
            how to do that??
                what we want all details of rooms 
               $notBookedRooms = select * from rooms where room_id not in (free rooms).

           

3)COUNT TOTAL ROOMS REQUIRE :

    NOW CHECK ROOM REQUIREMENT :
    first get number of guest, if does not provide set it to 2.
    if provided than check is grater than 2 if yes than only count total rooms require for the guest.
    
    how to do that ?? 
        divide total guest by max_occupancy of the room.


        foreach (FREEROOMS as freeRoom) {
          $roomsRequired =  total_guest / freeRoom[max_occupancy]
        }

        store the result in the roomsREquired ARRay

    what we need, 
        total guest, max_occupancy

     Simple : 
      1) get total_guest
      2) iterate into the freerooms.
      3) check for each room by dividing total_guest with max_occupancy of that room.
      4) now store that rooms require in to array called RequiredRooms. WITH room_id   
    
    
    
4)COMPARE REUIRED ROOMS WITH AVAILBE ROOMS 

     1) GET REQUIRE ROOMS ARRAY 
     2) ITERATE INTO FREE ROOMS
     3) ITERATE  BOOKED_ROOMS        
     4) ITERATE  REQUIRED_ROOMS ALSO       
     5) NOW CHECK  AVALBILE ROOMS= FREE_ROOMS->TOTAL_ROOMS - BOOKED_ROOMS 
     6) IF AVALBILE >= REQUIRED_ROOMS['require_room'] 
     7) IF ABOVE CONDATION IS  TRUE MEANS ROOM IS AVAILBE STORE THAT ROOM'S ID IN TO ARRAY CALLED AVAILABLE_ROOMS_ID_FOR_REQUIRED_ROOMS  

5) RUN ELSE PART & PASS THESES ALL ROOMS ID
        IN SIMPLE IF THESE IDS ARE GETIING THAT MEANS ROOMS ARE AVAILBE OTHRWISE NOT
